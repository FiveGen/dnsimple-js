This project contains a simple example of how to import the DNSimple JavaScript library into a web
page.

The dnsimple.js file must be on your server and provides a loading mechanism to include the full
API script from the DNSimple site into your page.

Please note that this project uses CORS (http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) and thus requires a browser
that implements the CORS specification.
